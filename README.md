# spermbank

## Note to potential employers: ignore this repository.

Yeah, yeah. I know what you're thinking: what the WHAT? no. it's actually very cool. this project converts worlds from anvil region format to my own custom .sperm format.

It's less disgusting than the naming of this project lets on. Yes, this is a serious project. Why is it called spermbank? Well, it's because it takes your world which is like genetic information and turns it into a frozen version, "sperm" which is used to inseminate a WorldServer. Could I have chosen a more *eloquent* analogy? Absolutely. I have no intention to change though.
